# Letter-Inventory
The LetterInventory class allows users to store and keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in a string. It ignores the case of the letters, and ignores anything that isn't a alphabetical character (eg commas, periods, etc). Once stored, the user can use the methods associated with the object to manipulate and retrieve information.
