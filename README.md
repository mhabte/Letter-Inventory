# Letter-Inventory
The LetterInventory class allows users to store and keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in a string. It ignores the case of the letters, and ignores anything that isn't an alphabetical character (eg commas, periods, etc). Once stored, the user can use the methods associated with the object to manipulate and retrieve information.
